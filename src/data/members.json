(1991) and Ph.D (1996) in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Her major academic contributions are in the field of medical imaging, where she developed a computational technique to analyze cardiac motion from MR tagging data. Her recent work includes developing a VR simulator for dental treatment with haptic feedback, as well as understanding 3D interaction behavior in VR environment. She is also developing deformable models for morphometry study applied to aging brain structures. She is currently an associate professor in the School of Computing at KAIST, and leading Computer Graphics and Visualization (CGV) research laboratory. She also leads KAIST Special Interest Group of Future Emerging Technology on Medical Imaging."
